# Jade - Fashion Ecommerce Site:

This website was created as a deliverable in our sofware engineering course.

* Problem Statement:
To develop a fashion ecommerce website with 3 ends- customer, vendor and admin, which is more useful for the user.
* Need:
Most fashion ecommerce sites today don’t offer a lot of interaction between the customer and the vendor. Hence queries of customers often go unanswered.
* Solution: 
Fashion eCommerce site Jade - Can’t find your size? Want to find an online store? Contact the vendor by sending him your query!

## Process:

* Post the need identification a number of diagrams were created (for eg: Data Flow Diagram, Use Case Diagram & State Chart Diagram) to understand how the solution should be created, after which the site was coded keeping in mind UI/IX fundamentals.
* A deeper overview outlining the product pitch and some of the methods used can found in [this deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qrTnhToALQzIQT3Z9nqzJrqTDIAGZU-U9v1wNqE0JnA/edit?usp=sharing).
